# Hack at UCI: React.js Intro Workshop

Full demo code for Hack at UCI's Intro to React Workshop! This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Check out our presentation on React [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XjLBstc3PbuewfuyuI4ZwO7Lk91StZnI45dKvWjQTVw/edit#slide=id.gd38a374474_0_2498)!

## 🎒 Intro 🎒

This project is made up of various components, mainly: App (displays our application), Home (a container for our lists), List (a container which displays our table using CSS), MaterialList (a container which displays our table using the [Material UI library](https://mui.com/)). Our workshop breaks down React.js, and we hope to teach students about this component-based library in an easy-to-understand project!

The finished webpage should display a table of items (the contents of which are dynamic) which a user can select items to delete or add items through an input form. 

## ✏️ How-To ✏️

- Open up your terminal of choice (ex: Git Bash, Powershell, etc.), and clone this repository.
- Once you cd into your cloned repository, run `npm start` and the web page should open on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! 🎉🎉
- Open up the repository in your IDE of choice and try editing files. Whenver you save the file, you should notice the webpage re-rendering and displaying your changes.
- The main branch 🌳 contains the starter code for this project which has various TODO items. For the solutions to these tasks, feel free to look at our `finished-demo` branch.
